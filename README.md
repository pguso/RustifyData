# RustifyData

**RustifyData** is an upcoming high-performance, lightweight data manipulation library designed for Node.js, powered by the speed and safety of Rust. It aims to provide a dependency-free, efficient alternative to existing data processing tools like Pandas and Danfo.js, with a focus on being fast, intuitive, and simple to integrate into any Node.js project.

## 🚀 **Goal and Scope**

The primary goal of *RustifyData* is to provide Node.js developers with a modern, Rust-powered data manipulation library that can handle large datasets with ease. By utilizing Rust's performance capabilities, this library aims to make data handling faster, safer, and more memory-efficient without the need for heavy dependencies.
